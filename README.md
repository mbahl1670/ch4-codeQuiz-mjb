## How this was accomplished
* Created GitHub issues for each step of creating the quiz
* Wrote initial HTML & CSS pages for landing site
* Created array of questions and answers
* Set up an event listener for the start button
* Start button initiates a countdown function using setInterval function and displayes the first question
* Set up event listenrs to the main page, clicking on an answer advances the quiz to the next question
* Incorrect answers will subtract time from the countdown timer
* Created and endQuiz function, when timer reaches 0 or all questions are answered the function is called
* Multple event listeners created for the buttons useded in the endQuiz area, (initials, submit initials, go back to restart quiz, clear the high scores)
* When initials are submitted they are stored to local storage

## Known issues
* Multiple places in the code that could use refractoring, ran out of time however
